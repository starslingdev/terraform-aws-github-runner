# Runner Tier Definitions
#
# These are the fixed tiers available to all tenants.
# Tenants select tiers by using the appropriate labels in their workflow files.
#
# Example workflow:
#   jobs:
#     build:
#       runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, medium]
#       steps:
#         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#         ...
